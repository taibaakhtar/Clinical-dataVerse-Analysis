# Clinical DataVerse Analysis

This project is on "AI-Driven Patient Follow-Up and Health Outcome Prediction System for Telemedicine"
It is divided into two parts such as:
- Lung Cancer Dataset Project
- Doctor-Patient Conversations Dataset Project

Lung Cancer Dataset: Performing some basic statistical analysis to summarize the data, including measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical attributes and converting the categorial to numerical values. Also identifying patterns, trends, or any anomalies.

Doctor-Patient Conversations Dataset Project: Performing NLP preprocessing on the corpus dataset such as tokenization, stemming and stopwords removal. Also performed sentiment analysis on text data to get some insights, and we're solving two problem statements in this project such as "Classification of general query and emergency query" and "Identifying illnesses and correlating them with issues like weakness or difficulty in daily activities"
