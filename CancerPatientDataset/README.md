This project focuses on analyzing a lung cancer dataset and building predictive models to classify cancer levels. Below is an overview of the tasks performed:

### Data Summary

Conducted basic statistical analysis to summarize the dataset:

Numerical Attributes: Calculated measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.

Categorical Attributes: Converted categorical data into numerical values for analysis.

### Pattern and Trend Identification

Explored patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset to understand key insights.

### Predictive Modeling

Used machine learning models to predict the level of cancer:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest Classifier

### Key Steps

Data preprocessing: Handled missing values and converted categorical data.

Statistical analysis: Identified important patterns and trends.

Model training: Built and tested KNN and Random Forest models for predictions.

Outcome

Gained insights into the dataset through statistical analysis.

Built reliable models for cancer level prediction using KNN and Random Forest.
