She received an offer from a brain dead, 9-month-old female donor with a terminal creatinine of 0.2 mg% and donor weight of 10 kilograms. The recipient-to-donor weight ratio was roughly six-to-one. After performing the standard multi-organ procurement, it was noted that the donor left renal vein was essentially dismembered from the inferior vena cava (IVC). This prohibited performing the standard en-bloc technique to transplant the kidneys. Normally, the suprarenal IVC is sutured closed, and the infrarenal IVC is spatulated at the iliac bifurcation for anastomosis to the recipient iliac vein. The pediatric kidneys were divided on the back table similar to an adult kidney procedure. The left renal vein was separated completely. The aorta was split down the middle and Carrel patches were made around the renal arteries. The right renal vein was elongated using the donor IVC in the standard fashion, and a venotomy was made on the side of the IVC for the anastomosis. The transplant then proceeded normally by exposing the right iliac vessels. Adequate exposure was achieved. The internal iliac veins were ligated and divided to elevate the external iliac vein and allow for a tension-free anastomosis. The external iliac artery was dissected to its full length, from the takeoff of the internal iliac artery to the inguinal ligament. The two kidneys were transplanted by stacking them on the same side. The left kidney was placed higher to allow the longer vein to cross over the iliac artery. The arterial anastomosis was performed using Carrel patch to the external iliac artery. The iliac veins were reconstructed in the usual fashion to the external iliac veins. Schematic diagram of the techniques is demonstrated in Figure . We used 7.0 non-absorbable monofilament stitches in a running fashion for all anastomoses. Both kidneys were reperfused simultaneously (Figure\",\n          \"This 7-year-old girl is the only child of non-consanguineous parents. She was born at 39 weeks of gestational age via an urgent cesarean section due to maternal premature rupture of the membranes (PROM). At birth, she presented respiratory distress and her Apgar scores were 51 and 85. Her birth weight was 3550 g (75th centile), her length was 53 cm (90th centile), and her OFC 36.5 cm (around 98th centile). Soon after birth, she developed spontaneous tremors of the upper limbs, axial hypotonia, and apnea episodes treated with phenobarbital and oxygen, respectively. A brain ultrasound and MRI were normal. EEG displayed continuous activity, with occasional sharp elements in the right temporo-occipital area. Audiometric and fundus oculi examinations were both normal. She reached head control at 3.5 months, sitting position at 10 months, and non-autonomous standing station at 15 months. Up to 15 months, she presented difficulties in handling objects with coarse grip. Language was poor with very few words developed at 13 months. Psychomotor delay was accompanied by macrocephaly: until 4 months of age, OFC was at the 98th centile and from 8 to 10 months it was abundantly above the 98th centile. Upon physical examination, she presented with a broad and rounded forehead, a small nose with saddle root and anteverted nostrils, a reverse epicanthus, sparse eyebrows in the medial portion, fetal finger pads, ligamentous hyperlaxity, and a sandal gap with prominent heel (). Upon clinical evaluation performed at 4 years and 5 months of age, the young girl pronounced few simple words, walked with a broad-based gait and showed a lack of sphincter control.

Over the course of one year at age 15, she required four inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations and numerous outpatient and medication management appointments due to an acute onset of \\u201cseizure-like\\u201d spells, psychotic thinking, and seemingly schizophrenic symptoms, manifesting as auditory hallucinations (AH) and catatonic movements.

However, after an unrevealing neurology evaluation she was referred to psychiatry. Mood and anxiety disorders were also suspected due to fears of social situations, making mistakes, and trying new things in conjunction with irritability, muscle tension, insomnia, self-consciousness, stomachaches, and feelings of worthlessness resulting in self-blame.\\nAfter a few months of declining mental health, patient A began outpatient psychotherapy sessions, where she discussed issues with being bullied and social\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"conversation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3376,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Doctor: Good morning.

The patient took 75 mg of clopidogrel daily in addition to an 81 mg aspirin tablet. She reported a mild headache however had no change from her baseline mentation per family members with no evidence of obvious injury aside from a small area of ecchymosis near a small forehead laceration. She remained up and ambulatory with no further complaints. Ten hours after her injury the patient presented to the Emergency Department with stridorous and agonal respirations with a profoundly decreased level of consciousness. She was noted to have developed extensive ecchymosis on the anterior portion of her neck and chest. Her symptoms had begun rapidly shortly prior to arrival while lying in bed. Family reported that she had been in the constant company of her husband with no further falls or injuries that had occurred since her fall. The patient was intubated upon hospital arrival due to respiratory extremis with obvious swelling and crepitus noted on neck examination. A noncontrast CT scan of head was unremarkable while there was demonstration of a large retropharyngeal hematoma measuring 3.6 cm by 5.3 cm by 20 cm on a CT of the cervical spine with no evidence of fracture. Her hemoglobin was 9.5 gm/dL and platelets were 1234 per deciliter, with an INR of 3 and a slightly below normal and activated partial thromboplastin time of 23.9 seconds (reference range 25-35 seconds). A CT angiogram of the neck was subsequently obtained demonstrating active bleeding from the anterior ligaments of the vertebral column that was not felt to be amenable to embolization (). Given the extent of the hematoma intraoral surgical evacuation was performed with bleeding from the anterior vertebral spine controlled with Bovie cauterization, placement of topical thrombin, and drain placement. No reaccumulation of hematoma was noted during her hospital course.

Lab work over the preceding months had shown deranged liver function tests, concerning for right heart failure. He was admitted for intravenous diuretic and inotrope therapy. At his cardiology clinic appointment prior to this hospital admission, an ECG showed typical atrial flutter and diffuse low voltage []. A right heart catheterization showed moderately elevated right greater than left filling pressures with a right atrial pressure 18 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 21 mmHg and a Fick cardiac index 1.6 liters/min/m2.

A repeat TEE at the present admission showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% as well as the aforementioned septal hypertrophy []. However, due to the significant low voltage on ECG, despite the significant LVH on echocardiogram and history of hypertension, a cardiac MRI was ordered to rule out infiltrative cardiomyopathy as opposed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\\nThe images showed normal left ventricular chamber size with severe, asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, primarily involving the septal wall with a maximum septal thickness of 27 mm []. The LVEF was measured at 40%. Also noted was diffuse, global late gadolinium enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium, consistent with a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis []. The only extracardiac clinical finding suggestive of systemic amyloidosis was carpal tunnel syndrome.
