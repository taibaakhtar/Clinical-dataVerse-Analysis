# Doctor-Patient Conversations Dashboard:

This dashboard is designed to visualize insights from doctor-patient conversations. It provides an overview of key trends in symptoms, diseases, and patient demographics. The goal is to assist in identifying high-risk patients and make it easier for doctors to take timely actions. Below is a breakdown of the features and how the dashboard can be used.

## Features:
1. ### Overview of Data:  
   - Displays the total number of unique symptoms and diseases identified in the conversations.

2. ### Visualizations:
   - Word Clouds: Highlight the most frequently mentioned symptoms and diseases.  
   - Disease Distribution: A chart showing how diseases are spread across the patient dataset.  
   - Gender and Age Distribution: Provides a breakdown of patient demographics.

3. ### Risk Analysis and Scheduling:
   - High-risk patients are flagged based on the data, making it easy to prioritize follow-ups.  
   - Doctors can schedule meetings with high-risk patients directly through the dashboard. Meetings are automatically added to the doctor’s Google Calendar, along with the patient’s summary and risk level.

## Purpose of the Dashboard:
This tool helps doctors analyze conversations with their patients efficiently. By focusing on key patterns, such as frequently mentioned symptoms or high-risk indicators, it saves time and ensures urgent cases get the attention they need. Additionally, the built-in calendar integration streamlines scheduling, reducing manual effort.


## Technologies Used:
- Python for data analysis and backend logic.  
- Dash/Plotly for building the interactive dashboard.  
- Google Calendar API for meeting scheduling and notifications.  
- Google Colab for collaborative development and visualization.
